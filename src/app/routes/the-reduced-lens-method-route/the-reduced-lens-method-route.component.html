    <h2>None Of This Is Proven To Be True</h2>
    <p>No science has been properly conducted and then peer reviewed and then published and then accepted by the scientific community on the topic of myopia reversal.
        There are studies on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7839608/">inducing nearsightedness or farsightedness on animals with lenses</a>, and then
        there's evidence that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20562668/">myopia in humans is induced</a>, and also that
        <a href="https://endmyopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The_progression_of_corrected_myopia_with_pages_as_published_clean_10.1007_s00417-015-2991-5.pdf">
        lenses are the main driver</a> for increasing a person's myopia. There are also plenty of easily findable studies on myopia control and prevention in
        children, but the prevailing consensus in the scientific community still is that once you are nearsighted as an adult, there is no more hope for
        a return to clear vision.
    </p>
    <p>Some more recent studies (since at least 2010) have shown a dim light on the hope of vision recovery by proving that
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65151-5">even the adult eye shows axial length changes quickly when exposed to the proper
            stimulus within just an hour</a>
        (also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/opo.12450">1</a> and
        <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2126435">2</a>),
        but no study (that I know of at least) has attempted to show that this change in the refractive state of the eye back towards emmetropia (normal vision)
        can be permanent. In my opinion, the evidence that has been gathered so far is enough to at least make a serious attempt at reversing my myopia, though
        I remain skeptical still.
    </p>
    <p>The following essay is the framework for how myopia is caused and how myopia can be reversed, as I understand it.</p>
    <h2>The Theory Of Myopia Progression</h2>
    <p>As I was growing up, I was told that nearsightedness just "happens" to people, and that those people just need to wear glasses. I diligently wore my glasses
        as I was told to do since elementary school. Every year I would go back to the optometrist, he would remeasure my eyesight, and I would get a slightly
        stronger lens to wear that made my head feel a little funny and the world a little "big" for a while until I "got used to" them like the doctor said I would.
        Nobody ever told me how I was supposed to use my glasses, so I wore them when reading books, when playing games, when watching TV, at school, and every other
        place you can think of where I didn't actually need them. As you will soon see, your glasses aren't necessarily the problem, but rather it's how you use them
        that is.
    </p>
    <h3>Pseudomyopia</h3>
    <div>
        <p>There is a muscle in your eye called the ciliary muscle (or ciliary body), and this circular muscle surrounds the lens in your eye that bends the incoming
            light. When you look at things far away, the ciliary muscle is normally relaxed, and light passes through your eye and that light's focal point is on the
            retina. When you look at things close up, the ciliary muscle has to contract to squeeze the lens in your eye so that the incoming light bends properly to
            remain focused on the retina. The key difference between these two states is that distant objects allow the eye to relax, and close up objects force the
            eye to work and activate the muscle. Accomodation is the name of this process where your eyes change their state in order to bring images into focus.
        </p>
        <p>When you do too much close work (for example, working on a computer for hours a day every day for years and years), the ciliary muscle is basically forced
            to remain flexed for so long that a spasm in the muscle is induced which prevents the muscle from properly relaxing. This isn't too dissimilar to a muscle
            spasm in, say, your leg (charley horse) that makes it hard for you to fully re-extend and relax your leg. After you do close work for so many back-to-back
            hours, you will step away from your books or computer or phone to go outside, and then realize that you can't see things in the distance anymore. At this 
            point, you have pseudomyopia. It looks and feels like nearsightedness, but it is not actually myopia. If you would simply wait for your ciliary muscle to
            relax by reducing your close work and increasing your distance viewing, your distance vision would return. However, people simply don't know about this
            issue, they just tend to think that vision problems means they should go see an eye doctor. So off you go to the optometrist with your pseudomyopia.
        </p>
        <p>The optometrist performs what is called a subjective refraction by putting different lenses in front of your eyes and asking you about your visual
            acuity using the Snellen chart. You normally wouldn't need these lenses to score 20/20 on the Snellen chart but your ciliary muscle can't relax. The
            lenses that are now in front of your eyes are doing the work for you, and so you can only score 20/20 with them. The optometrist prescribes you some
            weak lenses around maybe -0.50 diopters or so, and you leave the clinic happy that you can see things in the distance again with the glasses. At this
            point, you are still not myopic (just relax your ciliary muscle to return to normal vision), but the glasses are about to change that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Hyperopic Defocus Creates Myopia</h3>
    <p>The optometrist didn't tell you how to properly use your glasses, so you go home with your new lenses and wear them everywhere. For distance vision, this
        is fine, as the combination of your locked up ciliary muscle and the lens make the incoming light hit your retina properly. However, your ciliary muscle is
        spasming due to your lifestyle of constant near work (books, video games, tv, phone use, etc), so you go right back to your normal habits, except this time
        you are wearing glasses. With a flexed ciliary muscle and a negative power lens in front of it, the incoming light now hits behind your retina instead of
        directly on it. This is called hyperopic defocus, and is what may make your new glasses "feel off" and may make your head hurt for a bit as you get used to
        this new focal plane.
    </p>
    <p>The eye's accommodation system desperately wants to bring everything you are looking at into focus, so how does the eye and brain react to this hyperopic
        defocus? The eyeball gets longer. By becoming longer, the light entering your eye becomes properly focused on the retina after passing through both the lens
        and contracted ciliary muscle. However, this longer eye now presents a problem for distance viewing. Your ciliary muscle still can't relax properly, so
        distant objects are now focused in front of the retina due to the retina's new position. Upon stepping outside again, you look into the distance and realise
        that things are a little blurry again. So, just like before, you go back to the optometrist to get your eyes checked. Your optometrist confirms that your
        vision has indeed gotten worse, and so they prescribe you stronger minus lenses, and you go home with new glasses.
    </p>
    <p>The cycle then repeats. You continue to do close distance activities with your high powered minus lenses on, the hyperopic defocus encourages your eye to
        become longer, the longer eyeball and spasming ciliary muscle make distant objects be out of focus, and the optometrist again gives you even stronger lenses
        that make the whole thing worse. Improperly using your distance glasses for close up work has now given you real myopia, and eventually the day comes where
        you take off your -5.00 diopter or stronger glasses and can't see anything. If only you didn't use your glasses when you didn't need them, and if only you knew
        to relax your eyes by taking distance vision breaks often, then you wouldn't be in this position. You had no idea though, and neither did your family, and
        honestly your optometrist probably didn't really know either. Everyone was acting in good faith, but now you are permanently damaged.
    </p>
    <h2>The Reduced Lens Method For Vision Therapy</h2>
    <p>Are you permanently damaged though? Let's examine the process that got you here. The eyeball explicitly became longer when a very specific state was applied to
        it. That state was hyperopic defocus, where the focal point of the light was behind the retina. If this was the stimulus that got your eyes into this mess
        in the first place, what would happen if you applied the opposite stimulus?
    </p>
    <h3>Myopic Defocus Reverses Myopia</h3>
    <p>Myopic defocus is when the focal point of the light entering your eye is in front of the retina, the opposite of hyperopic defocus. If the length of the eyeball
        follows the focal point of the light relative to the location of the retina, then putting that light in front of the retina should make the eye shorter. It's
        not a very quick process, as evidenced by how long it typically takes people to become highly myopic, but it should (at least in theory) work the exact same
        way. So, the problem now becomes: How do you induce myopic defocus on your eyes in an effective way in order to reshape them? 
    </p>
    <h3>Applying Myopic Defocus</h3>
    <p>The tool that got you into this mess also happens to be the key to get you out of it. Your glasses bend the light coming into your eye to make it focus on a
        specific place in your eye, so you should be able to adjust the power of those lenses in order to change that focal point. How this manifests in practice is
        that you reduce your lens power by just enough so that things in the distance are just very slightly blurry. When distant things start to show some blur, that
        is the evidence that the focal point of the light entering your eye is in front of the retina. Keeping your eye in this state and focusing on this "blur horizon"
        stimulus should be the key to reversing your nearsightedness.
    </p>
    <p>However, this isn't really feasible. You have a life, and that includes your responsibilities of maybe a close distance job and close distance housework, and your
        passion may be in a book or on the computer. You are going to be doing lots of near work activities very often, and getting outside for distance vision to
        keep that blur stimulus active is going to be difficult. Is there a way to stop your near work activities from cancelling out any gains you may make from
        distance vision?
    </p>
    <p>Remember that your near work helped cause your problems by forcing your ciliary muscle to contract. When you look into the distance and see the blur horizon,
        it is because even a fully relaxed ciliary muscle can't completely resolve your refractive error. You know now that you can adjust where that blur horizon
        starts by messing with the power of your lenses though, and so there exists a specific power of lens you can wear that would put your blur horizon directly
        on the thing you are looking at for near work. Your eye will try to relax the ciliary muscle as much as possible to see these close up things on your blur
        horizon, and if your ciliary muscle is relaxed then you shouldn't become any more myopic than you already are. The blur horizon is the evidence of your myopic
        defocus too, which is the stimulus you should be tying to stay in.
    </p>
    <h3>Summarizing The Reduced Lens Method</h3>
    <p>Putting together all of this information, we are left with the following key points that make up The Reduced Lens Method.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Stop Near Work From Increasing Your Myopia</dt>
        <dd>Close distance viewing combined with high powered lenses are making your ciliary muscle spas and inducing hyperopic defocus (light focused behind the
            retina), which is causing your myopia. Get a second pair of glasses that are significantly weaker than your normal glasses. These near work glasses should
            put your blur horizion (the point where things start to become blurry) directly on the thing you are looking at, to force your eye to relax in order to
            see those close things clearly. Typically, this is between -1.00 and -2.00 diopters less than what your distance glasses currently are, but every case is
            different. If your prescription is low enough that you can see your close distance activities clearly without any glasses, then simply don't use your
            glasses.
        </dd>
        <dt>Create A Distant Blur Horizon To Reverse Myopia</dt>
        <dd>Your full strength glasses are almost certainly too strong. Get a new pair of distance glasses for far viewing that are a little bit weaker. Typically,
            this is -0.25 to -0.50 diopters less than what your current prescription is. When your prescription is high (-8.00 or more), the change in diopter values
            affects your clear vision distance by a smaller amount, so you may need even higher than a -0.50 reduction before you see blur in the distance. When your
            prescription is low (-3.00 or less), the change in diopter values affects your clear vision distance to a much greater degree, meaning that you will most
            likely only have to step down -0.25 diopters before you see noticable blur in the distance. This blur in the distance is myopic defocus (light focused in
            front of the retina) and is the primary stimulus that tells your eyes where the retina should be located. Since the focal point of light is in front of
            the retina, the eye should push the retina forward to reach that focal point. If the myopic defocus is too strong, the eye may not respond, so be careful
            and reduce your lens power by only a little bit.
        </dd>
        <dt>Use Distance Vision As Much As Possible</dt>
        <dd>You are going to want to look into the distance and into the blur as much as you are able to in order to stimulate your eyes to reshape themselves. This
            will involve getting outside and away from near work activities often. Sharp contrast of familiar patterns will show you the blur best, which will
            typically be text. The longer you are outside and actively recognizing and noticing the blur and trying to see through it, the more myopic defocus stimulus
            you are applying to your eyes. The more of this stimulus you can get, the more likely your eyes will adjust to match the stimulus.
        </dd>
        <dt>Reduce Your Lenses As Your Vision Improves</dt>
        <dd>As your vision clears up and you notice the blur horizon fading away (perhaps by testing yourself with a Snellen chart, or measuring your clear sight
            distance with a ruler), you will need to acquire weaker distance and near work glasses in order to keep your blur horizon on the things you are looking
            at. This process can be very slow. Keep in mind that it took many years for your eyes to become myopic, and so it will most likely take many years for
            them to return to normal. Repeat the process of reducing your lenses when you notice clearer vision gains until you are able to get rid of your glasses
            entirely.

    <h2>My Personal Implementation of The Reduced Lens Method</h2>
    <p>Below is a summary of the habits that I am trying to stick with to improve my vision. This is an ongoing list of things that I believe will help me, but does
        not represent the habits I have had the entire time I have been trying this experiment. I will update this list with dates as I add, remove, or change things.
        Anything without a date was a part of my plan since starting in the Spring of 2023. These habits represent my everyday routine, and I will break them when my
        daily routine is also broken, for example when taking trips with my family or on holidays.
